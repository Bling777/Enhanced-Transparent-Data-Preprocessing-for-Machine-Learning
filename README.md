# **Enhanced Transparent Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning**

This project provides a robust and transparent framework for preprocessing data for machine learning. It allows users to easily upload datasets, perform data profiling, apply preprocessing pipelines, and visualize the results in an interactive interface. The framework aims to simplify data cleaning and transformation while maintaining high flexibility and transparency.

## **Features**
- **Data Profiling**:
  - Automatic generation of summary statistics and data insights.
  - Identifies missing values, correlations, and other key metrics.

- **Data Logging**:
  - Tracks the progress of preprocessing steps for better reproducibility.

- **Preprocessing Pipelines**:
  - Modular and reusable pipelines for data transformation and cleaning.

- **Interactive Visualization**:
  - Provides an intuitive user interface for visualizing processed data and exploring results.

- **Dataset Support**:
  - Works seamlessly with `.csv` datasets and other common data formats.

## **How to Use**

### 1. Upload Dataset
- Upload a `.csv` file using the interface.
- The system will automatically generate a data profile.

### 2. Apply Preprocessing
- Select preprocessing steps from the UI.
- Apply transformations such as missing value imputation, scaling, and encoding.

### 3. Visualize Data
- Use the visualization tools to explore your dataset.
- Generate correlation heatmaps, distribution plots, and more.

### 4. Export Results
- Save the preprocessed dataset and profiling report for further use.

## **Examples**

### Example 1: Customer Churn Analysis
1. Upload the dataset `churn.csv`.
2. View the profiling report to identify missing values and correlations.
3. Apply transformations to clean the data.
4. Export the cleaned dataset and use it for modeling.
